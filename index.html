                        upcoming products. In an attempt to keep up with social distancing KBIS moved to a digital format for 2021. 
                        General Electric, one of the KBIS participants, tasked my team with the challenge of creating a single
                        web application to host 9 different brands. I was one of 2 front end developers tasked with taking flat mockups and
                        implementing them into an MVC environment. The following 2 projects are 2 of 4 sites I developed for GE's KBIS web application.

                    we developed a structure that allowed us to use the index pages as a sort of controller. This allowed us to use Razor pages as partial views, which helped
                    to significantly reduce the size of the application.

                    The Cut is one of many clients I was assigned during my time at Popmenu Inc. There it was my responsibility to do one of two things for my clients;
                    I was either migrating their existing site into Popmenu's own proprietary platform, or I was creating something entirely new for them. In the case of The Cut, 
                    they had an existing site, but were looking for a completely new design. I recieved what we called the client's DC (a document that had all of their design 
                    needs written out), took in the information, and created their current website.

                    I began my journey with Hudson design agency as a contract web designer but very soon after working with him the owner asked, asked me to design and develop the company's website. 
                    He and I had several "face-to-face" zoom meetings to discuss his ideas
                    and vision for the website. I took that information and initially created 3 different designs in Figma that we later fine tuned and combined into one. 
                    We had several options for how to develop the site and initally I was going to code it by hand, but ultimately we landed on using the platform Webflow.

                <p>
                    U.S.A. Staffing Solutions was one of the clients I worked with through Hudson design agency. Initially I built the site in Squarespace, but being a 
                    staffing company, they soon realized that Squarepace wasn't going to serve their needs. Instead WordPress seemed to be a better fit, so I migrated the site 
                    to WordPress and built the pages using Elementor. I also integrated Bullhorn and Matador Solutions plugins to streamline the process of collecting applicantions
                    and data from potential clients.

                <p>
                    I am a leading Front End Developer with experience in applying deep technical knowledge and creative
                    design sense to create stunning and functinoal websites. I combine sound technical frameworks
                    with appealing media assets to generate front end solutions focused on enhancing user experience.
                    I'm capable of highly organized multitasking with expertise in writing CSS, developing original designs,
                    and project management.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I began my journey with coding and web development in high school. At my first job I was tasked with updating 
                    an <i>ancient</i> Sharepoint site using HTML and CSS. Being a kid born in the mid 90's I had experience editing preexisting 
                    HTML in an attempt to make my MySpace or Tumblr page the most unique thing amongst my those of my friend group. Needless
                    to say something about coding and web development has stuck with me all this time. While I was in college I fell in love with
                    design volunteering for the TV station on campus. I desginded everything from flyers and social media graphics for our 
                    marketing department to web banners for our website. Once I graduated I had the opportunity to bring my love of coding and 
                    my love of design together with my first contract job. In that position I was tasked with leading the design and development
                    of an internal micro-site meant for exclusive members of their website, or for their sales team as a means of keeping
                    an inventory of specific brands of product. From there I began a freelance career designing and developing various web sites and web 
                    applications for a number of businesses. I've expanded my coding knowledge far beyond just HTML and CSS and have even started developing
                    projects of my own outside of my professional work.
